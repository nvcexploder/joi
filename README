The joi library is meant to provide caching associated to hapi requests.
The cache obscures the data store for simple key value storage.

Currently supported are MongoDB and Redis

A few samples may help.
Note: you can't get immediately after a set it is async

var JoiClass = require('../../joi');

var joi = JoiClass.create();

joi.clearCacheForRequest(req, function() {});

joi.setCacheForRequest(req, data, function() {});

joi.getCacheForRequest(req, function(cache) {
	
	if (cache) {

		console.log('cache: ' + cache);
	}	
});
